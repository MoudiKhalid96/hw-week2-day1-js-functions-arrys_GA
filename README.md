#### Exercise 1:
Where can you print out the value of variable c without resulting in an error?

```js
var a = 1;
function x() {
  var b = 2;
  function y() {
    var c = 3;
    function z() {
      var d = 4;
    }
    z();
  }
  y();
}

x();
```
1. anywhere in the script! 
2. anywhere inside the function `x()` 
3. anywhere inside the function `y()` 
4. anywhere inside the function `z()`

- Write a function that chooses two random numbers (1-6) and returns them. It should also return the sum.
- Example: `rollDice() // Dice rolled are 6 and 1.  Sum is 7`

- Example: `rollDice(3) // Dice rolled are 4, 2, and 7.  Sum is 13.`

#### Exercise 3: currencyConverter(currency, amount)
  - Write a function `currencyConverter` that takes two arguments an amount and a currency (USD, GBP, EGP, BD) and returns  the converted version of the amount in Riyals.
